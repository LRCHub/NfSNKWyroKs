What this world needs is a few more rednecks
People with the nerve to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck
And I'm full of American pride

I got a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in mindin'
No one's business but my own

And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame ol' John Wayne
Didn't live to run for president

And I'm a catfish connoisseur
And I love the Lynyrd Skynyrd band
And I'm crazy about the NFL
And I'm a die hard NASCAR fan

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
People with the nerve to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothin' but a workin' man
And he makes his livin'
By the sweat of his brow and the calluses on his hands

Now you intellectuals may not like that
But there ain't nothin' that you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common folks
Then there ever will be of you

Now they wanna take my guns away
They just keep on trying
Well you all take 'em away from them terrorist guys
But you ain't getting mine

'Cause if I ever get my sights
All over Bin Laden's ugly face
I'm gonna pull that trigger
And blast that S.O.B. out of space

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
People with the nerve to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

That's what we need, ya'll
And a few more rednecks is what we need
