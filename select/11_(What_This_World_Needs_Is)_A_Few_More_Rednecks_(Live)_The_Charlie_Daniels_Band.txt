What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

I was raised on beans and cornbread
And I like my chicken fried
Yes, I drive a pickup truck
And I'm full of American pride

I keep a Bible on my table
I got a flag out on my lawn
And I don't believe in mindin'
Nobody's business but my own

And I love them Rambo movies
I think they make a lot of sense
And it's a shame ole John Wayne
Didn't live to run for president

And I'm a catfish connoisseur
I love the Lynyrd Skynyrd band
And I'm crazy about the N F L
I'm a diehard NASCAR Fan

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need

Now they're tryin' to take my guns away
That would be just fine
If you take 'em away from the criminals first
I'll gladly give ya mine

And I don't mind payin' taxes
But it makes my temper itch
When my hard earned money goes
Just to make some politician rich

What most people call a redneck
Ain't nothin' but a workin' man
He makes his livin' by the sweat of his brow
The calluses on his hands

Now you intellectuals may not like it
But there ain't nothin' you can do
'Cause there's a whole lot more of us common-folks
Then there ever will be of you

What this world needs is a few more rednecks
Some people ain't afraid to take a stand
What this world needs is a little more respect
For the Lord and the law and the workin' man

We could use a little peace and satisfaction
Some good people up front to take the lead
A little less talk and a little more action
And a few more rednecks is what we need
And a few more rednecks is what we need
